Pushing my practice js code into this respository
```
OBJECTS:--------------
-->Creating an object with object literal will cause changes in one instance of the object to be reflected in all the instances.
-->While creating with new() does not reflect the changes in all the instances.
-->In multi-word properties, the dot operator does not work.
-->let bag = {
-->[fruit]: 5,//computed properties
-->};//take the name of key from the fruit vaiable
-->If 0 is used as a property, it will be automatically converted into a string "0"
-->Find if a property exists:
-->user.name === undefined //true means no such property//doesn't work when the user.name exists and is set to undefined
-->alert("age" in user); //true, user.age exists
-->iterate over keys in object "i in obj"
-->functions are stored in objects just like key-value pairs
-->sayHi: function(){}
-->(or) sayHi(){}
-->Garbage Collection in JavaScript is known as Mark-and-Sweep
-->All objects except marked ones are removed.
-->GC cannot be forced or prevented in JS
-->typeof new Number(0)//object
-->Primitives are not objects//strings are not objects
